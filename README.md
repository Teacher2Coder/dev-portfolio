On the Contact page, the user can fill out a form and send a message to me. Formsubmit.co handles the form and sends me your message!

On the Portfolio page, the user can browse some of my projects that I have gotten to work on and sort them by the type of project. Each project includes a link to the GitHub repository associated with it. If a deployed link is available, one will be shown as well.

On the Resume page, the user can observe my resume and some of the information that is on my resume as well as a button so that the user can download a .pdf copy of my resume.

At the bottom of the page, the user can click on links to my GitHub, my LinkedIn, and my X account.
